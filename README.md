# My-Python-Projects
Hi, I'm Nicholas, a middle schooler who loves video games, Python, and computers!
These are some of the Python projects I have made! I am a beginner right now, and I only know the basics of Python. 

I have created simple projects using Python. My love for video games like Minecraft and Roblox introduced me to the wonderful world of coding. I tinkered around with Scratch for a while before I really decided to dive into this amazing world. 

At first, looking at my dad's coding on Java was extremely complex, so I decided to use Python. Since I had prior experience with Scratch, I used that to connect the similarities between blocks coding and Python. I was surprised to see that there were many similarities! Variables are used in both ways of coding, but Scratch was more focused on visual code, while Python was all about text. The first thing I learned was the importance of printing in Python, and how much it's used in many projects.
