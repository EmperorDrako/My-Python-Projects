# My-Python-Projects
Hi, I'm Nicholas, a middle schooler who loves video games, Python, and computers!
These are some of the Python projects I have made! I am a beginner right now, and I only know the basics of Python. 

I have created simple projects using Python. My love for video games like Minecraft and Roblox introduced me to the wonderful world of coding.
